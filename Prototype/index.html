				  	<h2>Assessment Services</h2>
				  	<p>Our assessment services are designed to provide customers with 
				  	preliminary consulting services on their existing technical infrastructure with 
				  	regards to their business processes and goals. The next level would be to make 
				  	recommendations on integration of Open Source solutions into the existing 
				  	framework. This initial assessment allows the parties involved to get a clear 
				  	insight on requirements and solutions respectively, which clearly is the 
				  	foundation for a successful implementation of the given solution.</p>

		  	<h2>Implementation and Integration</h2>
		  	<p>Our Implementation and Integration services assist in initial 
		  	deployment, with a broad range of test and quality assurance measures. One of 
		  	the main service offerings within the integration phase is migration of existing 
		  	contents. During implementation process, any customisation requirements that 
		  	were deemed necessary during the assessment phase can be undertaken.</p>
		  	<h2>Customisation</h2>
		  	<p>We offer dedicated solutions, unique to each companyÂ´s business 
		  	practices and processes. Customisation may involve development of extra modules, 
		  	deletion of some existing features from the standard solution, compatibility 
		  	extension to additional tools and technologies and so on. Benefit from the 
		  	flexible nature of Open Source.</p>
		  	<h2>Open Source</h2>
		  	<p>Open Source is a central topic in the IT business today. We build Open
		  	Source Software, because we belive in the concept. If you want to learn more about the advantages, read about it in <a title="Open Source Software" class="internal-link" href="open-source-software">What is Open Source Software.</a></p>
