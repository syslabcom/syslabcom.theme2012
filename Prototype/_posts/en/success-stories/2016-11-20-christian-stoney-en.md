summary: "Keeping an overview of my business"

Using Quaive to keep an overview of what's going on, to track and document our core processes and to find out what needs attention.

## Background

I use our social intranet extensively to track the processes in our company. Every day, new processes - usually unstructured ones - are triggered by incoming mail, requests from other organisations or internal needs. As an organisation of public law, we are required to document the decision making process in a transparent way. We must always be able to tell who did what. And we need to freeze and archive all the material used in the decision making afterwards.

So no matter what source the new request has, I am creating a new case for it. I can pick from a list of predefined templates, which have different workflows attached and I assign one of our departments to handle it. Immediately the permissions are changed so that the new department can access it and work on it.

## Using Cases

Cases are basically workspaces where people can share documents. A case always starts with a document that represents the initial request - or trigger if you will - for it. It may be a letter asking for a subsidy or even an order from a parent organisation. They all have in common that one of my colleagues need to read it and to decide what next action needs to be taken. Whatever that is, it is worked on and an application document is written as a result.

Once the specialists in the department are done, the case is assigned to quality assurance for a crosscheck. Is the wording correct, has the financial department been involved, are all metadata set, is the format right so that an actual decision can be formally taken? If all is well, the case gets scheduled for a session of the board which has to take a decision.

## Paperless meetings

Sessions of the Board are Events in Quaive. Everyone in the organisation can find them in the central calendar. Such a session event has an agenda attached. There we can find all the cases that are scheduled to be decided on that day. I can send a preliminary agenda to all invitees. This is much better than a paper agenda, because the notification email contains simply a link to the event and every invitee will always see the current status. If we change the agenda, I send out another notification.

On the day of the session, nobody needs paper. All participants just open the agenda on their laptop or tablet and look up the cases. They can read the application documents, but also all related material that was used to create the application - if necessary. They could also look up the tasks that were completed to arrive at the final application. Who did what when with which outcome. Before that we have not been able to go into such a level of detail. As a result, we are taking more decisions and have less postponements.

The note taker doesn't write into a Word document anymore - like before. Instead he is working directly in the system. If an application is accepted, he switches the state of the case to "decided" and notes the decision. If it is rejected, the same happens. If a case can't be decided and gets postponed to the next session, he is simply reassigning it to the next session event. If the fact that a case is postponed needs to be documented, the note of the postponement is made and the new, refined application document is assigned to the next session instead.

## Keeping track

After the session, we start doing our homework. The decisions are executed, stakeholders are notified, money gets allocated and paper is printed where still necessary. Once that is done, we switch the case into the closed state. There it remains for a while until we are confident that nothing else will happen and we archive it.

It is very valuable that I can still locate content from archived cases in the search. Or I can simply let the system display all archived cases so I can browse them. This is especially helpful if a similar request is coming in. Also the search puts newer documents higher up in the results. So I can still find archived content, but it will not pollute my results for my day to day work.

And last but definitely not least there is the case manager app. It allows me to track progress in my organisation on a high level. I can see and filter on all cases that I have access to.

This makes it possible to cross check over all my cases. I can check if there are cases that have not been assigned to a department for work yet. Or show all cases that haven't been worked on in a long time. I can see which cases are not yet scheduled for any session for decision, which gives me an indicator of upcoming volume. And I can see if there are cases that still need closing or which can be archived now, as they have been closed for a certain time without modification.

The fact that all cases are displayed with their full progress bar gives me an indicator of how far we are at one glance.
