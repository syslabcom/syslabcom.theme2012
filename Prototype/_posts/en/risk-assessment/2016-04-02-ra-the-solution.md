### Step 1: Identification

The Occupational Safety and Health experts of your organisation have created a questionnaire for all hazards (via the the built-in content management system). Now the individual heads of the different departments can go answer the questions based on the situation on site.

In this process, it is sometimes much easier to stand directly in front of a machine or production facility, rather than sitting at the desk back in the office. Therefore the questionnaire can be answered just as easily on a smartphone or tablet device - no extra app needs to be installed!

### Step 2: Evaluation

It is up to the creators of the questionnaire to define how the priority for each risk should be set:

* Calculated: Based on the answers for _frequency_, _probability_ and _severity_
* Estimated: A simple choice between "low", "medium" and "high"
* Pre-set as "high": For hazards that are marked as especially important
* Skipped: In this case, the content creators must set the priority beforehand

You can interupt your risk assessment at any time during any phase, and pick up where you left off next time. All your replies are kept, but only you have access to them!


### Step 3: Action Plan

To tackle the risks that have been identified, an action plan is created. For every hazard, one or more measures can be defined - in other words, an instruction on **what** to do, **who** is responsible and **until when** the measure should be completed. Optionally, every measure can also be assigned a **budget**.

This will enable you to deal with your hazards, one by one.

### Step 4: Reporting - Keep it up to date


Improvements are never finished! After implementing the plan you discuss its progress with your employees every year. If you make changes in the company, the risk assessment needs to be adjusted, too. So, if you have finished your (first) risk assessment, you have started to improve the health and safety standards in your company. And you will have provided thorough documentation on the results to all involved parties.
