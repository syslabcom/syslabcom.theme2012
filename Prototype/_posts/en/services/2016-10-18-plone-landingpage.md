# Open Source BY SYSLAB.COM
Open Source is a central topic in the IT business today. We build Open Source Software, because we believe in the concept. With Open Source Software (OSS) the source code as opposed to proprietary software is made available and can be changed. An open (and therefore normally larger) group of developers work on the software. Improvements are constantly published in the newest (developer) version. Because of the licence model there is no revenue from licensing or the selling of OSS-software. Business models are mainly based on consulting services, implementation, integration and maintenance.

Benefit from the flexible nature of Open Source with Our Services!

* Assessment: Our assessment services are designed to provide customers with preliminary consulting services on their existing technical infrastructure with regards to their business processes and goals. 
* Implementation and Integration: Our Implementation and Integration services assist in initial deployment, with a broad range of test and quality assurance measures. One of the main service offerings within the integration phase is migration of existing contents. 
* Customisation: We offer dedicated solutions, unique to each company's business practices and processes. Customisation may involve development of extra modules, deletion of some existing features from the standard solution, compatibility extension to additional tools and technologies and so on.
