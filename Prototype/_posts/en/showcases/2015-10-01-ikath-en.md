## Conversion from analog to digital

Cooperation in the synodal council has so far largely been paper and email supported. Now contents are saved in workspaces that are accessible from anywhere. The exchange happens via messages in the Activity Stream. It is a breeze to set the proper access rights.

## Fiscal control online

An important part of this is the comprehensible standardized settlement of transactions. The predetermined process steps are stored as structured workflow. Each milestone includes predefined permissions governing access to documents, whereby obligation steps are displayed.

Simultaneously, the task management integrates into the milestones. For each phase of the process, each agent can define tasks to be done here, memories and important deadlines. Tasks can be commented and concluded be anyone, if necessary. This part of the business control is open, flexible and should first of all provide simple support.

Through a presentation system different business case types can be stored, which can be pre-configured with tasks and documents.

## Search with preview

Office documents are still an integral part of most work environments. Finding the correct files is a constant challenge. The integrated search engine provides full-text indexing, filtering by metadata and document type as well as thumbnails. This makes it a cinch  to locate the correct file. As the preview images are produced in high quality, they are directly readable. Thus, often you don't even have to open the document to obtain the necessary information.

## Solid planning and implementation

The iKath project was implemented in the first half 2015, based on <a href="http://quaive.com">Quaive</a> and is since October 2015 in production. Currently approximately 200 users are working on the system. In the final stage, up to 2500 users are expected.
