A fairly typical day at work for me. Busy, but not stressful - thanks to our Quaive intranet!

## Organising meetings

As the assistant to the head of our department, one of my recurring jobs is to organize meetings. And that's not just about finding a date and inviting the right people, but also making sure the necessary documents get prepared in time.

Next week, for example, our "New Markets" task-force will hold a meeting to review the past quarter and decide on the next measures. My boss Christian just confirmed the date, so now I can send out the invitation. In the past, I would have done this in Outlook. But many colleagues complained that they are being flooded with emails already, and I can't blame them. Therefore I go into the "New Markets" workspace, create an event for the meeting, and invite the "task-force" group. This means they now see this event not only in the workspace calendar, but also in the calendar app and on their dashboard. And only those colleagues who have opted in also receive an email about it. But everybody sees that they have a new notification when they open Quaive the next time. And once they open the event, they are already in the workspace, where they can find the agenda. I remember, back in the days when we relied on emails, that I had to re-send the agenda to at least one participant per meeting…

## Assigning tasks

My colleague Esmeralda is currently setting up a new office in Costa Rica, and we will review the progress in next week's meeting. I head to the "New San José office" case, which already contains a milestone for the audit meeting. I add a task "Create report on recruitment status" for Esmeralda and set a deadline 2 days before the meeting, so she'll have time to prepare it. No further action is necessary, since I know that she will get a notification about this new task, and a second one, should she forget and let the deadline pass. And I can check any time in the case overview if the task was marked as done.

## Picking up work when it suits me

Two days ago I had uploaded a spreadsheet with last month's figures into the "Sales" workspace. The little red icon on the notification icon made me aware that Jamie, one of our financial experts, had commented on the document and proposed some improvements in making the numbers easier to grasp. The notification takes me directly to the spreadsheet, and with a further click I open it directly in Excel. After I'm done with my changes, I close the spreadsheet - the updated version automatically replaces the old one in the workspace, and a new preview gets generated. But I'll still be able to look up previous versions via the history overview. With a shudder I think back to the days when we used to send files like "July-sales_final_amenedment2-comment_Peter" back and forth…

## Social intranet at its best

I head into our tea kitchen to make myself a cuppa, and notice that my favorite brand is running low. A quick check also confirms that we'll need to restock our supply of softdrinks. And remember that both Jamie and Paula recently said they would prefer more variety when we had lunch together. Back at my desk I write a status update in our "Maple Road office" workspace that I'll be placing a new order with our caterer. I attach their list of available brands and ask my colleagues for any special wishes. All of the local staff will see this in their activity stream, but none of the people from other offices will be bothered by useless information. Shortly before I leave in the evening, I look at the replies. Apart from Paula and Jamie, three more colleagues have replied - including one who's working from home today, and one who's on a mission in Paris. I can consider their wishes when I send out the order to our caterer. Sometimes it's the small things that keep our team happy and motivated.
