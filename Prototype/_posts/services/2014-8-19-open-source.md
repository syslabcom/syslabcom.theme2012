Open Source is a central topic in the IT business today. We build Open Source Software, because we believe in the concept. With Open Source Software (OSS) the source code as opposed to proprietary software is made available and can be changed. An open (and therefore normally larger) group of developers work on the software. Improvements are constantly published in the newest (developer) version. Because of the licence model there is no revenue from licensing or the selling of OSS-software. Business models mainly base on consulting services, implementation, integration and maintenance.

- With OSS there is no dependence of single software companies, but a multiple development of software for different platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS).
- There is a high amount of developers, therefore development is fast.
- The application is stable and secure.
- The software solutions are specifically adjusted to the companies that use them.
