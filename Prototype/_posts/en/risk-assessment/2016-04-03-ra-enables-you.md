An RA consists of two parts: a LIST with all the risks to your company and a PLAN to deal with them. These two components allow you to limit the risks to your employees and your company, and therefore also the financial risk.

# The RA is not complicated, but compulsory!

Complicated? Not really. It just takes a bit of time. However, the RA is important. So important that governments have made it compulsory for almost all entrepreneurs with employees. An RA is a legal requirement. Euphorie Risk Assessment makes it simple.
