Open Source is a central topic in the IT business today. We build Open Source Software, because we believe in the concept. With Open Source Software (OSS) the source code as opposed to proprietary software is made available and can be changed. An open (and therefore normally larger) group of developers work on the software. Improvements are constantly published in the newest (developer) version. Because of the licence model there is no revenue from royalties. Business models mainly base on consulting services, implementation, integration and maintenance.

- Security: As the sources are open, bugs can be fixed early.
- Independence: With Open Source software there is no vendor lock in.
- Extensibility: There are no limits to extend the software to custom needs.
- Cusomisation: The software solutions are specifically adjusted to the companies that use them.
