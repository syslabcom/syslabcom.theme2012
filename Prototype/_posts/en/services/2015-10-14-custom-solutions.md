#### Open Source

We build Open Source Software because we understand the power of working together effectively.
By sharing the code we write, and by using the code others write in an open manner we can improve the collective code base together.
The constant refinements and enhancements feed back directly to our customers.
Since more developers are familiar with the code, there is a large pool of talented developers we can draw from.
This is what makes it possible to provide solutions for even the most niche requirements.

There is no licence fee associated with using the software.
This doesn't only save money, it also makes it easier to work in larger groups and experiment with alternative approaches to reach the best solutions.
Because we don't get income from royalties, our business model is to provide services, custom solutions, integration and maintenance.

Advantages of Open Source software:

- Security: Many people can identify security issues, so bugs are fixed early.
- Independence: With Open Source software there is no vendor lock in.
- Extensibility: There is no artificial limit on how the software can be extended.
- Cusomisation: Software is adjusted to match the exact requirements.


#### Custom solutions based on standard software

The Open Source ecosystem covers every field imaginable.
Mature and reliable technologies are available which can often be used without any customisation.
Where possible, we take advantage of these solutions and apply them to your organisation as appropriate.

#### Stable and future proof

We implement solutions closely following the best practices for core Plone and <brand name> development.
This is necessary to assure that solutions can be easily upgraded and don't conflict with security hotfixes.
We are happy to also provide service levels to maintain all custom development - just specify your needs, we will cover them.
