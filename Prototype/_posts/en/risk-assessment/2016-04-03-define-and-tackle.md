A Risk Assessment consists of two parts: a LIST with all the risks to your company and a PLAN to deal with them. These two components allow you to limit the risks to your employees and your company, and therefore also the financial risk.

#### A Risk Assessment is not complicated, but compulsory!

Complicated? Not really. It just takes a bit of time. However, the Risk Assessment is important. So important that governments have made it compulsory for almost all entrepreneurs with employees. A Risk Assessment is a legal requirement. Our Risk Assessment tools make it simple.


#### Reducing risks in four steps

These four steps are the best way of reducing the risks:

- *Identification*: All the hazards in your company on one list
- *Evaluation*: Determine the level of each risk
- *Action Plan*: Indicate how to solve the risk and plan who does what and when?
- *Report and keep it up-to-date*: Done? Then you are on your way!
