Sharing challenges, ideas and solutions early needs the right media. The wider success of social media in our online society leads to demand to apply the benefits and skills to use them to corporate applications.

Show what can be done and collect the results. Share access to internal and external resources wider and faster. Get immediate feedback to improve and decide.

#### Case management workflows

Processes can be structured obviously like underground lane diagrams and show up all steps of the workflow for all team members and administration levels. Steps that are distributable in parallel can be checked with the team in parallel and secured before reaching the next milestones. Clear structures provide optimized results without restricting too far.
