#### Let's work together

If your company already has a web team, we can share our experience and join in on development projects.
In addition to software development, we can help with technology selection, strategy development, procurement as well as project management.

#### Assessment

We can assess how well your existing systems fit your organisation's processes and goals.
Based on our analysis, we can then recommend particular Open Source solutions that can supplement or replace parts of your system.
With a clear picture of your requirements and an overview of the available solutions, you can make an informed decision on which technological investments can have the greatest impact.

#### Python and Plone consultancy

Experience with a wide range of technical solutions over the years has convinced us to specialise in a particular technology stack.
We use Linux and Python as the basis of all our solutions.
Our CMS and intranet systems specifically are built with Plone, a well respected, battle hardened and flexible CMS.
SYSLAB.COM is one of the largest and most experienced Plone development companies in Germany.
We facilitate organisations in scaling their platforms effectively for high volume.
If your team needs some extra support or training, we can provide tailor made courses and advice on best practise development, testing and deployment.
Naturally, we can also help integrate Plone systems with the databases and user management systems you already have in place.

#### Design and usability

User experience is even more important than the technology under the hood.
In order to give our clients an accurate impression of how the finished product will look, we have created an Open Source prototyping framework for designers called *Patterns*.
This framework allows a designer to create a fully working prototype without any server side code.
Your team can click through this prototype at an early stage in the process, giving us a chance to iron out misunderstandings and explore additional ideas before we start working on the server side implementation.
This approach is invaluable for ensuring we are working in the right direction and collecting feedback.
We also take considerations such as accessibility and support for mobile platforms into account during this stage so that we work towards a comprehensive solution.
Once the prototype phase is complete, we don't throw it away.
We develop the server side code to hook into the prototype.
This ensures that you get the exact user experience you expect.
It's also worth noting that since we already use a modern and user-focused CMS as the basis of our systems, a custom design is not always necessary or appropriate.
