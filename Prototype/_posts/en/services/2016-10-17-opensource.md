# What is Open Source?
Collaboration, Transparency, rapid Prototyping and much more... 
Open Source is a dynamic philosophy striving to promote free distribution and access to the source code of any software.

# The Open Source Way
Open Source represents a central topic in the IT business today. Doing things the “Open Source way” is not just an idea, but first and foremost an attitude about sharing knowledge through a constant exchange of information and participating in a strong community. We build Open Source Software, because we believe in this concept. Thus keeping an “open mind” is an essential craft in creating strong and innovative solutions.  

# Making the source code available
With Open Source Software (OSS) the source code as opposed to proprietary software is made available and can be changed. An open (and therefore normally larger) group of developers work on the software. Improvements are constantly published in the newest (developer) version. Because of the licence model there is no revenue from royalties. Business models are mainly based on consulting services, implementation, integration and maintenance.

- With OSS there is no dependence of single software companies, but a multiple development of software for different platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS).
- There is a high amount of developers, therefore development is fast.
- The application is stable and secure.
- The software solutions are specifically adjusted to the companies that use them.
