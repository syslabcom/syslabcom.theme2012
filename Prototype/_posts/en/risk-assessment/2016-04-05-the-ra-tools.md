## Step 1: Identification

All the hazards on one list: draw up a list of all the hazards in your company (or you can ask an expert to conduct your Risk Assessment)

Your Risk Assessment must answer the following six questions:

- Have there been any past accidents in my company?
- What could currently go wrong in my company, causing accidents or absenteeism?
- How great is the chance of this happening?
- How do I limit a risk or the damage, if something goes wrong?
- What precautions are necessary? And how do I implement these?
- How do I ensure that the precautions continue to work?


## Step 2: Evaluation

You define the risks.The result is a summary of the bottlenecks in your company. For each bottleneck you will evaluate the magnitude of the hazards.

## Step 3: Action Plan

Next step: Compare all the risks on the list and place them in the correct order. Which risks are the most threatening? The third step is: set time periods for tackling the risks in your company. Who will start working on which risk? What will it provide? In short, a plan of action. This allows you to resolve the risks one at a time, preferably at the source.

## Step 4: Report - Keep it up-to-date

Improvements are never finished! After implementing the Plan you discuss the progress with your employees every year. If you make changes in the company, you must change the Risk Assessment too. So, if you have finished your (first) Risk Assessment, you have only just started. You have started to improve the health and safety standards in your company.
