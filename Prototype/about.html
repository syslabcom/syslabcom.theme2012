<p>Syslab.com is a Munich based software development and consulting company founded in 1998. We create powerful web-based applications and content management systems for organisations, government bodies and multi-national companies.</p>

<p>Over the past 5 years we have carried out over 100 projects for small, medium and large corporate and public sector clients. Our team members are acknowledged experts in the deployment, customisation and use of Zope and Plone and we maintain strong connections into the open source community.</p>

<p>We specialise in Open Source technology, because we believe in the concept of free software and take part in the community to promote it. We offer Open Source based products, content management solutions, consulting services and support.</p>

<p>Since 2001 our developments are integrated solutions based on Zope and Plone, a full featured platform acting as stable and reliable base for the quick and cost effective tailoring of CMS solutions. Due to the Open Source licensing agreement, there are no license costs with regards to duration of its use or number of users.</p>

<h3>Websites</h3>

<p>Businesses of today cannot improve their operational efficiency nor create or optimise revenue streams without looking to the web. There is an increased demand for online services and a rapid growth of the internet. It is therefore imperative to understand the people who use the systems that we create.</p>

<p>If you want to be successful, it is not enough to have a simple website. You must be connected with other websites and social media (like twitter, facebook, linkedin and so on). The constant exchange of information blurs the borders of every single site, creating massive and dynamic communities that are deeply intertwined.</p>

<p>We are used to working with high volume webpages based on big communities. Through the changing landscape of the software industry, we have gained the experience and expertise to create clear strategies and produce meaningful solutions based on powerful, adaptable technology. Every one of our projects is unique and is treated as such. For that we apply the following core competencies:
<ul>
<li>Requirements Analysis</li>
<li>User Scenarios / Stories</li>
<li>Concept Generation</li>
<li>Content Planning</li>
<li>Wireframing</li>
<li>Interface Design</li>
<li>Data Interaction / Workflow</li>
<li>Prototyping</li>
<li>Software Development</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Quality Assurance</li>
<li>Training</li>
<li>Maintenance and Long Term Support</li>
</ul>

<p>We use the Open Source content management system Plone as a foundation for most of the projects we work on. We consider ourselves strong defenders of the Plone community. To help promote the cause and advance the software we organise development events and speak at conferences. For this reason we are also among the premium sponsors of the Plone Foundation.</p>

<h3>Consultancy</h3>

<p>Besides technical development and doing end-to-end projects, SYSLAB.COM also offers consultancy services. If your company already has a web team who handles your internal requirements, we can provide services in developing strategy, choosing appropriate technologies, procurement and configuration, right through to project management and integration. We have worked successfully as consultants with a wide variety of organisations - from public sector (Universities, Healthcare and Defence), through to all sizes of private sector organisations (from SMEs to global multinationals).</p>

<h3>Zope and Plone Consulting</h3>

<p>We are one of the largest and most experienced Zope and Plone development companies in Germany. We help organisations in scaling their platforms effectively for high volume, speed and performance by investigating their systems and solving situation-specific problems. So, if you are in need of support, we can work with your organisation to help coach internal staff on the best practice, use, deployment and development of solutions based on Zope and Plone. Our implementation and integration services assist in initial deployment, with a broad range of test and quality assurance measures. One of the main service offerings within the integration phase is migration of existing content. During the implementation process, any customisation requirements that were deemed necessary during the assessment phase can be undertaken. All our core developers are strongly involved with the Plone and Zope community, ensuring that our team is up-to-date on the newest technical developments. Thus a consultant from SYSLAB.COM can rapidly assist your team with any aspect of the deployment or optimisation of Zope or Plone.</p>

<h3>Design and Usability Consulting</h3>

<p>Is your website design in need of a refreshing brush-up or does your organisation have problems with an existing site or application that does not work fully to your satisfaction? Then we can help. Our web designers and strategic consultants are flexible and work independently or in tandem with our technical experts. We offer dedicated solutions, unique to each company´s business practices and processes.</p>

<p>Where a full design and build project is not appropriate, we provide simple but effective solutions to achieve your objectives. Customisation may involve development of extra modules, deletion of some existing features from the standard solution, compatibility extension to additional tools and technologies.</p>

<h3>Support</h3>

<p>Communication is the essence of any kind of cooperation. We develop our solutions together with our clients. In our assessment services we aim to clarify business processes, requirements and mutual goals from the start to give our customers the best possible recommendations on the integration of Open Source solutions into their existing technical framework.</p>

<p>Often clients may find the concept of Open Source great, but fear the lack of support, if they don’t have a central vendor. But since the ideological foundation for the entire software community is openness, there is no reason for fear. The community provides hundreds of highly skilled and professional companies offering development and support resources for Plone. And of course, we too provide support throughout the entire span of a potential project.</p>
