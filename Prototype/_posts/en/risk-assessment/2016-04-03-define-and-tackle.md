A Risk Assessment consists of two parts: a list with all the risks in your company and a plan on how to deal with them. These two components allow you to limit the risks to your employees, and thereby also the financial risk.

### The questionnaire: centrally defined - answered on site

It is up the the appointed safety and health experts in a large organisation to define a list of all potential risks and create a well-structured questionnaire. But ticking off the individual questions needs to be done on site, and this job usually falls to the respective head of a production facility or chief technician. It is important that the questions are presented in an easy to use tool with a clear structure, so that performing a risk assessment will not be perceived as tedious extra work.


#### Reducing risks in four steps

These four steps are the best way for reducing the risks:

- *Identification*: All potential hazards in the company on the list are answered with Yes or No.
- *Evaluation*: All found hazards are assessed for their priority.
- *Action Plan*: Measures are defined on how to tackle the risks: **who** will do **what** and **until when**?
- *Report and keep it up-to-date*: The current state of your risk assessment and the action plan can be downloaded at any time.
