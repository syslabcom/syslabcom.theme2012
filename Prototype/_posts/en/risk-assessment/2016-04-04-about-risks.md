In every company or organisations numerous risks are present which can endanger the health of its employees. This could be an accident involving one of the machines, exposure to dangerous substances, repetitive strain injuries... All these can cause outages of staff and a throttled  production.  Then there are still the costs for repairs and healthcare. Not to mention the danger to your reputation.

To achieve this, many organisations are already using the instrument of **risk assessment**. Often considereable effort is put into this process, combined with a large paper trail.
