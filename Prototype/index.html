				  	<p>Our assessment services are designed to provide customers with
				  	preliminary consulting services on their existing technical infrastructure with
				  	regards to their business processes and goals. </p><p>The next level would be to make
				  	recommendations on integration of Open Source solutions into the existing
				  	framework. This initial assessment allows the parties involved to get a clear
				  	insight on requirements and solutions respectively, which clearly is the
				  	foundation for a successful implementation of the given solution.</p>
				 </div>
				 
				 <div class="row" id="implementation">
				 	<img src="Media/Implementation-Integration.png" alt="Magnify glass" class="illustration float-before" />
					<p>Our Implementation and Integration services assist in initial
					  	deployment, with a broad range of test and quality assurance measures. One of
					  	the main service offerings within the integration phase is migration of existing
					  	contents. During implementation process, any customisation requirements that
					  	were deemed necessary during the assessment phase can be undertaken.</p>
			  	</div>

			  	<div class="row" id="customisation">
			  		<img src="Media/Customisation.png" alt="" class="illustration float-after" />
				  	<p>We offer dedicated solutions, unique to each company´s business
					  	practices and processes. Customisation may involve development of extra modules,
					  	deletion of some existing features from the standard solution, compatibility
					  	extension to additional tools and technologies and so on. Benefit from the
					  	flexible nature of Open Source.</p>
			  	</div>

			  	<div class="row" id="open-source">
			  		<img src="Media/Open-source.png" alt="" class="illustration float-before" />
				  	<p>Open Source is a central topic in the IT business today. We build Open
				  	Source Software, because we belive in the concept.  
					With Open Source Software (OSS) the source code as opposed to proprietary 
					software is made available and can be changed. An open (and therefore 
					normally larger) group of developers work on the software. 
					Improvements are constantly published in the newest (developer) version.  
					Because of the licence model there is no revenue from 
					licensing or the selling of OSS-software. Business models  
					mainly base on consulting services, implementation, integration and maintenance.</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>With OSS there is no dependence of single software companies, but a multiple development of software for different platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS).</li>
						<li>There is a high amount of developers, therefore development is fast.</li>
						<li>The application is stable and secure.</li>
						<li>The software solutions are specifically adjusted to the companies that use them.</li>

				<h2>We are looking for a software developer Zope/Plone.</h2>
				<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
