					  	<p>Our assessment services are designed to provide customers with

					  	recommendations on integration of Open Source solutions into the existing
					  	framework. This initial assessment allows the parties involved to get a clear
					  	insight on requirements and solutions respectively, which clearly is the
					  	foundation for a successful implementation of the given solution.</p>

					<p>The 60th Plone Tune-Up winner is Maarten Kling (Kabz|4D). Maarten has participated in many Tune-Ups and previously won a Tune-Up t-shirt.
